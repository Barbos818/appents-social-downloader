## Instructions

1. Navigate to a single Instragram / X post.
2. Click the Download button in this Chrome Extension.
3. Files and extracted data are downloaded to Downloads.

## Unique features

- based on regular HTML content already fetched by browser
- downloaded data.json contains post id, user name, captions, and view / comment / like counts in JSON format

```
// fields returned in data.json on download
// "raw" is additional data for debugging
export type TargetFields = {
  id: string;
  content: string;
  created_at: string;
  like_count: number;
  comment_count: number;
  view_count: number;
  user_id: string;
  user_name: string;
  raw?: JsonObject | null;
  errors?: string[] | null;
};
```

## Known Limitations

- One post at a time (no feed scraping)
- Only works in Chrome browser
- Can not save a post's video if streamed
